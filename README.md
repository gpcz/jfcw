Javascript Flash Card Writer

This is a program I wrote in early college (2004ish) as an experiment in writing code that writes code.  It lets you make flash card programs automatically by defining simple question/answer pairs.

The code needs to be updated to modern (and non-teenage-written) standards, which I will do over time.
