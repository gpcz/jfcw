JavaScript Flash Card Writer v1.0<BR>

<P>
Enter the number of question/answer pairs you want in your program:
<BR>
<FORM ACTION="fexp.html" METHOD="GET">
<INPUT TYPE="text" VALUE="20" NAME="pairs">
<INPUT TYPE="submit">
</FORM>
<P>
NOTE: This program was designed soley with <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla-based browsers</A> (for instance, FireFox) in mind.  All directions for
saving are the directions for saving in Mozilla.  If you use IE, you might be able to use File:Save As to save a flash
card set, but it will be in the subfolder that is created, and it will be called exp.html.  I suggest you use Mozilla
to use this program, though.
