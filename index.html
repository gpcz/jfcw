JavaScript Flash Card Writer v1.0<br />
By Gregory Czerniak
<p>Enter the number of question/answer pairs you want in your program:</p>
<form action="fexp.html" method="get">
<input type="text" value="20" name="pairs">
<input type="submit">
</form>
<p>
NOTE: This program was designed soley with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla-based browsers</a> (for instance, FireFox) in mind.  All directions for saving are the directions for saving in Mozilla.  If you use IE, you might be able to use File:Save As to save a flash card set, but it will be in the subfolder that is created, and it will be called exp.html.  I suggest you use Mozilla to use this program, though.</p>
